# House pricing predictions
## Introduction
The home seller whants as much as she can from their home and the buyer wants to pay as little as they can for a home. Ultimately the house price is set by the seller and accepted by the buyer because of the features it has. This notebook shows that the price of a home is made from different variables, both affecting it negatively and positively. I aim to build a model that will predict future sale price of each home using differeent variables describing the home. The data was obtained from kaggle compiled by Dean de cock. The data containes 79 explanatory variables describing the homes in Ames, lowa.

The data was cleaned, experimented in different models and one model was chosen at the end.
